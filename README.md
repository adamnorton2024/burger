# burger

An app to show knowledge of creating an ORM, and having it add, update, and delete from a database. 

Simply navigate to the deployed app.  You can create a new burger by putting on in the New Burger field and clicking the green button. 

It will appear in the New Burgers section.  

If you click the Eat icon, it will move to the Devoured Burgers section. This will update the Devoured boolean value in the db from false to true. 

If you then click the Trash icon, it will delete the burger from the page and the database.
